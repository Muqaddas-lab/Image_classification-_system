# 📦 Image Classification using CNN on CIFAR-10 Dataset

This project performs image classification using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** trained on the **CIFAR-10 dataset**. It includes:

- Training and saving a CNN model using **Joblib**  
- Loading the trained model for predictions  
- A **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** built with Tkinter for image classification
